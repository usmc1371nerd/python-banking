Creating a bank app using python. 

Worked on OOP and git actions. 

Tried to push code as project went on in each stage to create a timeline of commits.
This was a 7 minute tutorial from youtube user is Code Nust. I want to continue this project
and build onto it. Putting it into a flask enviroment and creating a website. 

Future of this project:
1. Add a database
2. Connect to AWS (need to learn more about lambdas)
3. Create a savings account
4. Add a exhange rate for other currency's
5. Select a front-end (Just HTML/CSS, or maybe React?)
6. add a savings account
